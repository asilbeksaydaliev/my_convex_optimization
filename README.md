# Welcome to My Convex Optimization
Hi guys. That is my Convex Optimization project. And I think, I have done it

## Task
The problem is solve the linear problem with use mathematical algorithms. For example: dichotomus method, newton_raphson method and gradient descent method

## Description
first I used minimize_scalar from scipy then dichotomus method and newton_raphson method and then it'll be little bit difficult. I use gradient descent

## Installation
Peoples can download it from my git profile

## Usage
It works on python or jupyter notebook
```
./python my_convex_optimization.py
```
